# Corporate Clash


A private server for Disney's now defunct MMO-RPG, Toontown Online.

# Merging

All merges should go through a three-step process:

1. PR goes up by creator when the changes are ready
2. PR is reviewed by another person
3. PR is reviewed and merged by a third person

For emergency/security merges, only steps 1/2 are required if time is an issue.
